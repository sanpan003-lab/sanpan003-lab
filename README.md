# Hi, I'm Sandip Panchal 👋
### Data Analytics Student | Aspiring Data Storyteller | Tech Support Veteran

I am currently pursuing my B.S. in Data Analytics at SNHU, transitioning from a background in Computer Networking and Technical Support. I enjoy bridging the gap between raw data and actionable strategy through Python, SQL, and Tableau.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: **Harvard's CS50 AI with Python**
- 📊 I’m focusing on: **Predictive Modeling and Spatial Analysis**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a deep background in Aviation logistics and Tech Support, which taught me the value of data integrity in high-pressure environments.
