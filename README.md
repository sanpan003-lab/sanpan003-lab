# 👋 Hi, I’m Sandip!

I’m a **Data Analytics student at SNHU** focused on turning messy, real-world data into clear stories. Whether it’s analyzing NYC traffic safety or national housing trends, I’m interested in how data can make our cities run better.

### 📊 Current Portfolio Highlights:
* **U.S. Housing Market Segmentation:** Using K-Means clustering to identify "market personas" across major cities.
* **NYC Collision Analysis:** Investigating the human behaviors behind city traffic incidents.
* **NYC 311 Service Requests:** Analyzing response times to improve municipal transparency.

### 🛠️ The Toolkit:
* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
  **Skills:** Unsupervised Learning, Data Cleaning, and Statistical Visualization.
