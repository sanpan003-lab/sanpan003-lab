# 👋 Hi, I’m Sandip!

[cite_start]I’m a **Data Analytics student at SNHU** focused on turning messy, real-world data into clear stories. [cite_start]Whether it’s analyzing NYC traffic safety or national housing trends, I’m interested in how data can make our cities run better[cite: 3].

### 📊 Current Portfolio Highlights:
* **U.S. [cite_start]Housing Market Segmentation:** Using K-Means clustering to identify "market personas" across major cities[cite: 2, 4, 12].
* **NYC Collision Analysis:** Investigating the human behaviors behind city traffic incidents.
* **NYC 311 Service Requests:** Analyzing response times to improve municipal transparency.

### 🛠️ The Toolkit:
* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
* [cite_start]**Skills:** Unsupervised Learning, Data Cleaning, and Statistical Visualization[cite: 4, 11].
